# Machine Learning Models Practice

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Models Practice** repository! This repository contains a collection of projects aimed at practicing various machine learning models on different datasets to predict outcomes. Each project focuses on a specific dataset and demonstrates the application of different machine learning techniques.

## Projects

### 1. Rock vs Mine Classification
This project explores the use of **Logistic Regression** to classify objects detected by sonar as either rocks or mines. A dataset containing sonar readings of various objects was used to train and evaluate the model.

- **Dataset:** [Sonar Object Dataset](https://shorturl.at/fipwL)
- **Model:** Logistic Regression
- **Training:** 90% of the dataset
- **Testing:** 10% of the dataset
- **Accuracy:** Over 80% in correctly classifying rocks and mines

This project serves as a basic introduction to machine learning algorithms, focusing on data preparation, model training, and evaluation.

### 2. Diabetic Prediction
This project implements a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** to predict whether an individual is likely to have diabetes based on a set of health-related features.

- **Model:** Support Vector Machine (SVM)

This project demonstrates the application of a classification model to a medical dataset, highlighting the potential of machine learning in healthcare.
